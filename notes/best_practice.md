1- Start with structure, not code

The most important step is setting up a clear project structure. Don't even think about writing code yet.

3- Customize your AI as you go

Create "Rules for AI" custom instructions to modify your agent's behavior as you progress, or maintain a RulesForAI.md file.

4- Break down complex problems

Don't just say "Extract text from PDF and generate a summary." That's two problems! Extract text first, then generate the summary. Solve one problem at a time.

5- Brainstorm before coding

Share your thoughts with AI about tackling the problem. Once its solution steps look good, then ask it to write code.

6- File naming and modularity matter

Since tools like Cursor/Windsurf don't include all files in context (to reduce their costs), accurate file naming prevents code duplication. Make sure filenames clearly describe their responsibility.

7- Always write tests

It might feel unnecessary when your project is small, but when it grows, tests will be your hero.

8- Commit often!

If you don't, you will lose 4 months of work like this guy [Reddit post]

9- Keep chats focused

When you want to solve a new problem, start a new chat.

10- Don't just accept working code

It's tempting to just accept code that works and move on. But there will be times when AI can't fix your bugs - that's when your hands need to get dirty (main reason non-tech people still need developers).

11- AI struggles with new tech.

When I tried integrating a new payment gateway, it hallucinated. But once I provided docs, it got it right.

12- Getting unstuck

If AI can't find the problem in the code and is stuck in a loop, ask it to insert debugging statements. AI is excellent at debugging, but sometimes needs your help to point it in the right direction.

While I don't recommend having AI generate 100% of your codebase, it's good to go through a similar experience on a side project, you will learn practically how to utilize AI efficiently.
