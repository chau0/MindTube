## What would you like to do next?

1. Start Phase 0 - Set up the actual code repositories and development environment?
2. Review/modify the roadmap - Adjust timeline or priorities based on current needs?
3. Deep dive into specific technical details - Examine particular components like the summarization pipeline or API design?
4. Create the initial project structure - Set up the workspace with proper folder structure and configuration files?
